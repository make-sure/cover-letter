1. Is it better to follow your dream or to investigate the job market when choosing a profession? Both, I would say. There should be a compromise between these two approaches. We should not chose a profession we don’t feel passionate about at all, just because it is perspective, because we won’t be good at it if we hate it, neither we should chose a profession that is our dream if it is likely that we won’t even have a chance to do it, regarding to the job market.
2. If you have the chance to address only 1 question to the CEO, what would it be? Explain why. The question I would ask a CEO is: How does he/she see the firm 5 years from now? The reason why is that I would like to be a part of ambitious and progressive workplace.
3. Describe a time where you made a mistake and how you handled it and what have you learned from it. I made a mistake during one team school project. As soon as we got an assignment I started searching for advanced features we can use to make out project stand out. At the end we did not have time for such things, because we did not estimate needed time well, since we were still unexperienced. I have learned to work step by step and upgrade software with time.
